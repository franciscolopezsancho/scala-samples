find out what's with MODULE, what it means

Maybe for the first commit. 

A value class is a class that will not allocate itself as an object at runtime. 
must extend AnyVal or an universal trait, and have just one value field.
Can only extend from universal traits ( UT extends Any, only defs, no inicialization )

Correctness:

while providing type checking you don't pay the overhead of object allocation



















Add the jar from the beginning
